This project does **not** require a Dockerfile.

Build systems automatically detect:

- Python version via `runtime.txt`
- Dependencies via `requirements.txt`
- Start command from `app.py`

### ✔ `runtime.txt`

To run this application with **Python 3.13.11**, set your `runtime.txt` file to:

```
python-3.13.11
```
